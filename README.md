Lowbrow.app
===========

You're working on your latest web application and you realize it's time to smoke test your interface. Gotta check everything lines up! You open (Chrome| Firefox|Safari|Explorer) and 30s later you're still loading 100 tabs, 15 extensions, and connecting to some secret HTTP API to deliver user statistics.

You just wanted to test `localhost:3000`.

Lowbrow solves the problem of just needing a HTML5, CSS3, JS E6 compliant browser. It has the same developer tools as every Webkit browser. It takes up very little memory, is fast to boot, and gets the fuck out of your way.
